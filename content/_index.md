title: "Git Workflow Tutorials"
---

This website hosts a series of tutorials explaining how to use [Git](https://www.git-scm.com/), through the GUI tool [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/) and cloud service [GitHub](https://github.com/).

# Chapters
1. **[Solo Workflow](solo)** - In which we learn how to use Git to track changes of files on our personal computer that we never intend to share with others.
2. **[Backing Up Repositories](backups)** - In which we learn how to use Git to back up our files (and their change histories) to the cloud.
3. **[Collaborative Workflow](collaborative)** - In which we learn how to use Git to collaborate with other people on a set of shared documents.
